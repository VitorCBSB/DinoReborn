ECS:
Game:
	- Generate scripts for:
		-- Enemy commands (can probably use the same as bullets)
		-- Waves of enemies
		-- Stages
	- Generate states for: menu, main game, pause and other things.
		-- In this case, Game States would probably be different Worlds.
	- Add sounds for... everything.
	- Add options for: sound/music level, controls.
	- Possibly also add a how-to-play screen with controls somewhere (probably in the main menu).
	- Add bombs too.
	- Add focus (slow down on Shift).
